# leaflet-challenge

For this challenge, I created a visualization for real-time earthquake data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file is unchanged from what was provided in the original documents. The CSS and JS files are in the 'static' folder. The earthquake data can be accessed in JavaScript through this link: "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson".

For the visualization, I used Leaflet to display one of their worldmaps. I opted to use the same map and focal point that Hunter Becker and Conner Dekok used after speaking with them briefly on some of the topics pertaining to this assignment. For each of the earthquakes that have happened over the past week a circle is placed on the map where the size corresponds to the magnitude and the color corresponds to the depth at which the earthwuake occurred. The map includes a legend that displays the depth ranges that correspond to each of the colors.

ChatGPT was also utilized in the editing of the colors of the depths and making the outlines of the circles more visible.
